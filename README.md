# Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly.js and Heroku

### ******Note*******
Additionally, this same code may be found in the plotly_biodiversity repository as there was a test for a different method of deploying to Heroku directly by linking Github in Heroku in this repository (compared to git bash.)

## Link to the deployed app:

https://biodiversitywithplotly.herokuapp.com/

Using Plotly.js and Heroku, the objective is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for the dashboard.

* Create a PIE chart that uses data from the samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from the samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

  * Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page

* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected (refresh)

## Step 2 - Heroku
Deploy the Flask app to Heroku.
